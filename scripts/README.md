This directory contains the code and notebooks used to run simulations, analyze results, and generate figures for the paper "Functional redundancy driven by isocitrate dehydrogenase enhance metabolic robustness in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 providing flexible flux control in TCA".

Dependencies

Recommended base:
- Python 3.8 or newer (3.9/3.10/3.11 recommended)
- Conda (miniconda or anaconda) is recommended for environment management

Common Python packages used by the scripts and notebooks (install via pip or conda):
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- plotly
- scikit-learn
- jupyterlab or notebook
- reframed
- cobra (COBRApy)    # for constraint-based metabolic modeling

Optional / domain-specific tools (install if needed):
- escher              # pathway visualization
- cameo               # strain design and flux analysis helpers
- gurobi or cplex     # commercial solvers (if used); otherwise use glpk or scip via optlang

Installation examples
1) Directly from the provided "environment.yml" file v√≠a (recommended):
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

2) Using conda:

- Create a new environment:
  conda create -n icdhyr python=3.10 -y
  conda activate icdhyr

- Install common packages via conda and pip (example):
  conda install -c conda-forge numpy pandas scipy plotly scikit-learn jupyterlab -y
  conda install -c conda-forge cobra optlang -y
  pip install escher cameo reframed

2) Using pip into an existing environment:
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install numpy pandas scipy plotly scikit-learn jupyterlab cobra reframed

Notes on solvers

- COBRApy requires a linear programming solver. Install a solver supported by optlang (e.g., glpk, scip, gurobi, cplex). If a commercial solver (Gurobi/CPLEX) is used for some analyses, you will need appropriate licenses and to configure the solver according to its documentation.

Running analyses

- Many of the scripts assume data are present under ../data/ and will write outputs to ../results/ or ../figs/. Check individual script headers for specific input/output expectations.
- Notebooks can be launched with jupyterlab or jupyter notebook and executed interactively or with nbconvert.

Reproducibility tips

- Generate a specific conda environment environment from the provided file "environment.yml".
- If analyses are computationally heavy, intermediate files may be included in data/ or results/.
