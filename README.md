# ICDHyr_context

This repository contains the analysis, data, and code supporting the paper "Functional redundancy driven by isocitrate dehydrogenase enhance metabolic robustness in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 providing flexible flux control in TCA". It gathers scripts, processed datasets, figures, and notes used to reproduce the computational analyses and figures presented in the manuscript.

Repository contents (high level):

- data/: exrpession datasets used for the analyses.
- models/: used and generated GEMs
- scripts/: instructions and tips for reproducing the code.
- results/: outputs from flux sampling and STRING analyses.
- figures/: figure source files and compiled images for the paper.
- docs/: supplementary notes and methods descriptions (if available).

How to reproduce the analyses:

1. Install required software and libraries as noted in scripts/README or individual script headers.
2. Re-run notebook to regenerate results in figs/ and results/. If any steps are compute-intensive, intermediate files are provided in data/ or results/ where applicable.
