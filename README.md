# ICDHyr_context

This repository contains the analysis, data, and code supporting the paper "Functional redundancy driven by isocitrate dehydrogenase enhance metabolic robustness in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 providing flexible flux control in TCA". It gathers scripts, processed datasets, figures, and notes used to reproduce the computational analyses and figures presented in the manuscript.

Repository contents (high level):

- data/: processed datasets and intermediate files used in the analyses.
- scripts/: code and notebooks used to run simulations, analyze results, and generate figures.
- results/: outputs from analyses including tables and plots used in the manuscript.
- figs/: figure source files and compiled images for the paper.
- docs/: supplementary notes and methods descriptions (if available).

How to reproduce the analyses:

1. Install required software and libraries as noted in scripts/README or individual script headers.
2. Inspect scripts/ for step-by-step analysis pipelines. Some scripts expect data in data/; others produce results in results/.
3. Re-run notebooks or scripts to regenerate figures in figs/ and results/. If any steps are compute-intensive, intermediate files are provided in data/ or results/ where applicable.
